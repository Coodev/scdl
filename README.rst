**Branch Note:** This branch is a patch-queue on top of master, applying patches
to work as seemlessly as possible on pre-ICS devices.

Description
-----------

Download songs from SoundCloud to your phone. Enjoy all your favorite songs
offline. No more laggy streams or exceeding your data plan. Just "share" your
song from the SoundCloud app and start the download from your wifi at home.  If
a download aborts repeatedly, make sure you have enough free disk space
available.

This app will only download songs that have been marked as available for
download by the corresponding artist! Adding songs to the music library doesn't
work automatically for some phones.

Please send bug reports via mail, Twitter or Google+, don't leave them in the
review. I can't help you there.

Downloader for SoundCloud is not affiliated with or endorsed by SoundCloud.
