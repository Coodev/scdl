FAQ:

> Can you implement feature X?
» Maybe. Use this form to submit your feature requests: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDNZUmYwLTFWd191Z3phRnF5RG5aUVE6MQ

> Will this download all songs on SoundCloud?
» No, you can only download those songs explicitly made available for download by the artists. Please respect their choice.

> I keep getting "Loading Track …" and nothing is happening. What's going on?
» Either your connection is flaky or your phone can't handle SSL connections properly. Try unchecking "Use SSL" in the preferences.

> Why do my downloaded songs not show up in the music player?
» Some older phones don't support modifying the library. With a bit of luck, after some time the music app will re-scan all media files on your phone. There's nothing more I can do, unfortunately.

> I found a bug/have a suggestion. How can I contact you?
» Please contact me via EMail, Twitter or Google+. DONT leave them in the reviews.
